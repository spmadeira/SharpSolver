# SharpSolver

Simple linear expression solver built using C#.
Project SharpSolver implements solver logic, SharpSolverUI and SharpSolverUI.Avalonia implement the solver application GUI.

This application uses:
- [BigRational](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ExtendedNumerics.BigRational/) for full precision calculations.
- [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/nunit) for unit testing.
- [WPF](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf) for Windows UI.
- [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia) for cross-platform GTK-based UI.
